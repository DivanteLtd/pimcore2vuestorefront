## Issue reporting guidelines:

Always define type of issue:
* Bug report
* Feature request

While writing issues, be as specific as possible
All requests regarding support with implementation or application setup should be sent to contributors@vuestorefront.io

## Pull requests

Here’s how to submit a pull request:

1. Fork the repository and clone it locally. Connect your local repository to the original “upstream” repository by adding it as a remote repository. Pull in changes from “upstream” often in order to stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.
2. Create a branch for your edits. Use the following branch naming conventions:
 * bugfix/task-title
 * feature/task-name
3. Reference any relevant issues or supporting documentation in your PR (ex. “OLOY: 39. Issue title.”).
4. Include screenshots of the before and after if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.
5.Test your changes! Run your changes against any existing tests and create new ones when needed. Make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.

If you have found a potential security vulnerability, please DO NOT report it on the public issue tracker. Instead, send it to us at contributors@vuestorefront.io. We will work with you to verify and fix it as soon as possible.
